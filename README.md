## About me
I'm a data scientist with accountancy background. 

Hello! I'm Jiahe Li, a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a strong background in financial data analytics, enterprise database management, and Python for finance. I completed my undergraduate degree in Accounting at Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance, specializing in ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) with comprehensive knowledge in financial reporting, strategic cost management, and business valuation.

I have hands-on experience in industry analysis and consulting through my leadership roles in various projects, including the PwC You Plus Anchor Project, where I led a team to conduct in-depth industry analysis, delivering professional reports recognized by PwC executives. My internship at PwCâ€™s ESG Innovative Education Services Department allowed me to sharpen my skills in competitive analysis, customer engagement, and marketing strategy development.

I am passionate about using data to drive business decisions and have a keen interest in exploring how financial data can provide insights that influence business strategy. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, R, and other data tools, I am equipped to tackle complex business problems and deliver data-driven solutions.
